        <p>The "Vehicle Routing Problem using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm" project aims to address the challenging logistics issue of optimizing the routing of vehicles to deliver goods or provide  services efficiently. This project leverages the principles of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to find near-optimal solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). This project addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem by leveraging the power of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm known for its effectiveness in solving combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

      <h2>What is Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm?</h2>
      <p>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. It is a population-based metaheuristic that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems. ACO is an algorithm that mimics the behavior of ants to find optimal solutions for complex optimization problems. The algorithm was developed by Marco Dorigo in 1992, inspired by the social behavior of real ants.</p>
