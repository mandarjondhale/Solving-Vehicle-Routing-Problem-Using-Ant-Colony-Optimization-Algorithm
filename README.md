# Solving-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Using-Ant-Colony-Optimization-Algorithm
In this project I demonstrated some test cases that shows the solutions for Vehicle Routing Problem by using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. 
Vehicle Routing Problem using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm

# Overview
This project aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor. The VRP is a combinatorial optimization challenge commonly encountered in logistics and transportation management, where the objective is to optimize the routes taken by a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to customers efficiently.

The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm mimics the foraging behavior of ants, allowing the vehicles to discover and refine optimal routes over multiple iterations. This project leverages the power of web technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and algorithm implementation.

# Features
- Implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the VRP using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Visualization of optimized routes using interactive maps or custom graphics
- Integration of real-world data for scenario-based testing and analysis
- Evaluation of solution quality metrics such as total distance traveled, vehicle utilization, and adherence to time windows
- Responsive design for cross-device compatibility and user-friendly interface
- Documentation and examples for easy understanding and usage

# Requirements
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Visual Studio Code (or any text editor of your choice)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Internet connection for potential map API integration or real-time data fetching



# Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the HTML and JavaScript files for setting up parameters, running the ACO algorithm, and visualizing results.
5. Customize the project as needed, such as modifying parameters, adding real-world data, or enhancing visualization.

# Usage
- Modify parameters such as number of vehicles, customer locations, demand, time windows, and algorithm settings in the JavaScript file (`script.js`) as needed.
- Run the ACO algorithm to optimize routes and generate optimized solutions.
- Visualize the optimized routes using interactive maps (e.g., Leaflet.js, Google Maps API) or custom graphics for analysis and evaluation.
- Evaluate solution quality metrics displayed on the interface to assess the effectiveness of the ACO algorithm in solving the VRP.
